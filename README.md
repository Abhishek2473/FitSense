**Overview**
FitSense is a computer vision-based fitness application that tracks push-ups in real time using a webcam. It leverages MediaPipe Pose Estimation and OpenCV to count push-ups based on elbow angles, providing users with an interactive and engaging experience.

**Features**
✅ Real-time push-up tracking using AI-powered pose estimation
✅ Automatic repetition counting based on correct form
✅ Visual feedback with counters, progress bars, and GIFs
✅ Countdown timer before tracking starts
✅ User-friendly interface with OpenCV overlays
✅ Lightweight and efficient

**Tech Stack**
Python 🐍
